<h1>BYOJS (Bring your own JS)</h1>
<p>This project is dedicated to promoting the practice of building web applications with JS.</p>
<p>No disrespect to the extremely common approaches involving various frameworks -- which are increasingly becoming their own DSLs, even with their own compilers! -- and also no disrespect for those who like JS-looking languages like TypeScript... but it feels like a lost art to build effective web applications using the core JS language.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with using great code that others have built in your applications; you don't have to reinvent everything. But there's also something to be said for using loosely-coupled (but well designed!) libraries instead of highly-coupled frameworks and platforms.</p>
<p>A guiding principle here is: always choose the least-powerful tool to get a task done. Moreover, the best solution is the one with the least amount of (complex, highly-intertwined) code necessary.</p>
<p><strong>BYOJS</strong> aims to champion this approach, and celebrate great web development practices.</p>
